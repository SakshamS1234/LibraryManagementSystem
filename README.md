# LibraryManagementSystem
A Library Management System with two tables - one for books and one for members. It implements basic CRUD operations (Create-Retrieve-Update-Delete) for both of the tables

To use this project, ensure that SQLite3 is installed in your system. This project uses Flask and SQLAlchemy to create the webapp and use a SQLite3 database as the backend storage of the data stored within the tables.
